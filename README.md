## Trello & Bug reporting

We used Trello for the agile component of development: https://trello.com/b/ylkpl4vL/agile-online-store. We also used GitHub's built-in Issues feature for bug reporting, as well as the Trello log.

## Build tools

We used Microsoft Visual Studio for the development of this application, which uses the integrated [MSBuild](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild?view=vs-2019) tool
